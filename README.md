# ScaleBuilder
PowerShell Core script for building and working with musical scales.

This is meant to be a Linux, PowerShell Core, modular script for building scale sheets in various keys for various instruments for my own practise. I intend to use the excellent LilyPond open source music engraving software to create the scale sheet and then use the generated PDF to practise from. I want to be able to do this on-the-fly using whatever scales I wish.

I was inspired by the Python 'Mingus' package, but I wanted to do something similar with PowerShell on Linux just because I can ;-). Whenever I get stuck I have a look at Mingus for inspiration so some (a lot?) of my algorithms look similar although I have to do things a bit differently in PowerShell.
